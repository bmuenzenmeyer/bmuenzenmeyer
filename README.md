# HELLO! 👋

I do a little of everything. Sometimes that’s called being a ~unicorn~ 🦄 or a ~jack-of-all-trades~ 🧰, but with the kids my mind often lands on Sneelock of the Circus 🎪!

Be sure to check out some of my favorite things from now and then:

| Thing | Why | Tech Stack | 
| - | - | - |
| [Sweet Love Adornments](https://sweetloveadornments.etsy.com) | Megan's pretty killer etsy shop! | NextJS |
| [Walls](https://brianmuenzenmeyer.com/walls/) | A digital place to preserve the ❤️ Megan put into our homes. | 11ty, Pantograph | 
| [Pattern Lab](https://patternlab.io/) | The open source project I was the lead maintainer of for many years. | Node, lerna, auto |
| [compassrose.js](https://compassrose.netlify.app/) | My first real open source effort. I've recently hosted it on netlify and left the code unaltered as possible, a sort of time capsule.  | jQuery | 
| [DoneDaily](https://donedaily.netlify.app/) | One of my first public web apps. I've recently hosted it on netlify and left the code unaltered as possible, a sort of time capsule. | grunt, sass, respond, yepnope, jquery, knockout | 

When not online, I am trying to find my ☕.
