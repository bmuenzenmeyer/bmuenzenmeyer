# HELLO! 👋

I do a little of everything. Sometimes that’s called being a ~unicorn~ 🦄 or a ~jack-of-all-trades~ 🧰, but with the kids my mind often lands on Sneelock of the Circus 🎪!

Be sure to check out some of my favorite things:

| Thing | Why |
| - | - |
| [Sweet Love Adornments](https://sweetloveadornments.etsy.com) | Megan's pretty killer etsy shop! | 
| [Walls](https://brianmuenzenmeyer.com/walls/) | A digital place to preserve the ❤️ Megan put into our homes. |
| [Pattern Lab](https://patternlab.io/) | The open source project I was the lead maintainer of for many years. | 

When not online, I am trying to find my ☕.
