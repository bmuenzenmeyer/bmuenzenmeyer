# HELLO! 👋

## COMING SOON!<a href="/posts/2024-open-source-open-doors/" title="🙃">*</a> My book about [open source software](https://brianmuenzenmeyer.com/hubs/opensource/).

> _“I've written this book as a new entry in the compendium of open source thought. I don't fancy myself a thought-leader and for that we are all fortunate. But it is informed by years of success and failure working with open source software. The advice is honest; the vision bold; the mandate modest.”_

I do a little of everything. Sometimes that’s called being a ~unicorn~ 🦄 or a ~jack-of-all-trades~ 🧰, but with the kids my mind often lands on Sneelock of the Circus 🎪!

Be sure to check out some of my favorite things from now and then:

| Thing | Why | Tech Stack | 
| - | - | - |
| [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) | Helping maintain one of the most consequential websites in our ecosystem. Learning lots. Helping others do the same. My proudest moments are the new contributors, the Grace Hopper attendees, and the [redesign](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/diving-into-the-nodejs-website-redesign). | [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) |
| [makeapullre.quest](https://www.makeapullre.quest/) | A _shelved_ community resource dedicated to improving the quality of writing & ease of assessing code changes. Sorta on hiatus. Great URL. | [next-i18n-starter](https://github.com/bmuenzenmeyer/next-i18n-starter) | 
| [next-i18n-starter](https://github.com/bmuenzenmeyer/next-i18n-starter) | I wrote this because I found it hard to compose all the demos and docs together into what resembled a fully functioning content-centric website. | [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) | 
| [Sweet Love Adornments](https://sweetloveadornments.etsy.com) | Megan's pretty killer etsy shop and [website](https://www.sweetloveadornments.com/) | [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) |
| [Walls](https://brianmuenzenmeyer.com/walls/) | A digital place to preserve the ❤️ Megan put into our homes. | [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Pantograph](https://github.com/bmuenzenmeyer/pantograph) | 
| [Pattern Lab](https://patternlab.io/) | The open source project I was the lead maintainer of for many years. | [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/), [auto](https://intuit.github.io/auto/) |
| [compassrose.js](https://compassrose.netlify.app/) | My first real open source effort. I've recently hosted it on netlify and left the code unaltered as possible, a sort of time capsule.  | [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) | 
| [DoneDaily](https://donedaily.netlify.app/) | One of my first public web apps. I've recently hosted it on netlify and left the code unaltered as possible, a sort of time capsule. | [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), [sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [Respond](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond), [yepnope](https://github.com/SlexAxton/yepnope.js/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [knockout](https://knockoutjs.com/) | 
| [Simple Shift Scheduler](https://simpleshiftscheduler.netlify.app/) | One of my first public web apps. Built for my father-in-law's business. I've recently hosted it on netlify and left the code unaltereed as possible, a sort of time capsule | [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) |

When not online, I am trying to find my ☕.
